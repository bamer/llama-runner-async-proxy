Action: Acknowledged user instruction to ignore Qt typing issues temporarily and focus on all other Pylance errors
Reason: User will handle Qt/PySide6 typing issues separately, allowing me to concentrate on core logic typing
Result: Will systematically eliminate all non-Qt Pylance errors across the codebase
