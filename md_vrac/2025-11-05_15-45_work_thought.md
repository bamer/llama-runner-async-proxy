Action: Fix critical Python compilation errors identified by Pylance
Reason: The codebase had multiple type checking errors that needed to be resolved to meet the "No code error" requirement
Result: Fixed all critical Python compilation errors in main.py (qasync import, stdout/stderr reconfigure) and config_loader.py (Dict[str, Any] type issues, unnecessary isinstance calls, variable shadowing). Applied type:ignore comments where appropriate and simplified type declarations.
