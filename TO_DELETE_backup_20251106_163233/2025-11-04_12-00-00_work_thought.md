Action: Initialized work log and retrieved Pylance diagnostics for the entire project.
Reason: To trace all reasoning and fixes according to Serena's workflow rules and prepare for systematic error correction.
Result: 248 Pylance errors identified; starting with config_loader.py as the highest-priority file.

Action: Added explicit type annotations to llama_runner/config_loader.py for variables: processed_runtimes, runtime_cmd, model_path, runtime, parameters, display_name, auto_discovered, auto_update_model, runtime_path.
Reason: Pylance was reporting "unknown" types for these variables due to missing type annotations, causing cascading type inference issues.
Result: Fixed the core typing issues in config_loader.py that were causing 30+ Pylance errors.
