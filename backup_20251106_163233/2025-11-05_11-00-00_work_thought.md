Action: Completed systematic type annotation for llama_runner/llama_cpp_runner.py, achieving 0 Pylance errors in this file
Reason: Following Serena's workflow rules for precise typing, English comments, and clean architecture
Result: Successfully eliminated all 27 Pylance errors in llama_cpp_runner.py through explicit type annotations and proper imports

[2025-11-05 11:10:00]
Action: Analyzed remaining error patterns across codebase
Reason: To develop targeted strategy for eliminating all 318 remaining Pylance errors
Result: Identified three main error categories: (1) Qt typing issues in PySide6, (2) dynamic dictionary typing in config_loader.py, (3) unused imports in test files

Action: Preparing to fix critical type mismatch in main_window.py: "ProxyConfig | dict[Any, Any] is not assignable to ProxyConfig"
Reason: This represents a fundamental type safety issue that must be resolved with explicit validation and conversion
Result: Will implement proper ProxyConfig validation function to ensure type safety
